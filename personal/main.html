                    <p>I deployed and configured Prometheus along with the Blackbox Exporter to monitor HTTP/S and TCP service endpoints using standardized probe configurations. I integrated Prometheus as a data source within Grafana, including setting up remote_write for seamless metric streaming to Grafana Cloud. I designed and published several monitoring dashboards, such as 30-day uptime gauges for service visibility, 24-hour heatmaps to track real-time probe results, and 90-day sparklines for long-term availability trends. To ensure reliable alerting, I developed Alertmanager rules that monitored consecutive probe failures and latency breaches, integrating notifications via Slack, email, and Microsoft Teams. I also created Python scripts to automate the sending of alert emails and Teams messages, enhancing the notification system’s reliability and customization. In a staging environment, I conducted quality assurance and failure injection testing by simulating network outages to validate alert triggers and system resilience. Finally, I authored a comprehensive production runbook detailing system architecture, performance tuning, upgrade procedures, and incident response protocols to support a smooth operational handover.</p>
