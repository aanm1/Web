    <p>This program provides you with the capacity to encrypt your messages using symmetirc key encryption</p>
    <p>Note: The algorithm runs the encryption lagorithm using the symmetric key concept, which meams that the 
        cipher text made by the algorithm can only be reversed o the plain text with the symmetic key used to encrypt 
        the key. This program offers encryption methods that it called "King" and "Mathematician". Please not that
        the symmetric key should remain confidential between the sender and receiver of the message.
    </p>
    <p> The leak of the encryption key may lead to decryptionof the Cipher text providing unauthorized access
        to the information
